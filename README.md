> “Practice makes the master.” - Patrick Rothfuss

This is an attempt to have a daily to do list, which will display what hasn't been done today in the console. 

The goal would be that there are several tasks which ought to be done daily: since I love a clean desktop, I print out these tasks (and these only) on the desktop using GeekTool and remove them as I complete them. I reset it daily. This way I am constantly reminded to practice. 

### Install

`npm install -g practice`
